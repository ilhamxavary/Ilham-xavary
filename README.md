### Publishing Changes

Install our Github App to auto propagate changes from your repo to your deployment. Changes will be deployed to production automatically after pushing to the default branch. Find the link to install on your dashboard.

#### Troubleshooting

* Mintlify dev isn't running - Run `mintlify install` it'll re-install dependencies.

* Page loads as a 404 - Make sure you are running in a folder with `mint.json`
